1.1	Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritis and chronic condition of joints that cause pain. The osteoarthritis market was estimated to be between $7.3-10b in 2024.1
Many products have been developed over the years like TriluronTM, which is thought to be a lubricant; KenalogÂ®, which is an intra-articular injectable steroid and have the adverse effects of causing hyperglycemia and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression; and oral NSAIDs, which is cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding and associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, etc. Recently hyaluronic acid-diclofenac (HA-DF) has been approved in Japan and PLGA microsphere Zilretta has been developed in US and Europe. Zilretta has greatly improved hyperglycemia but no significant difference between it and triamcinolone acetonide immediate release was observed.2
There is no single agent approved for muti-factorial osteoarthritis condition. Current drugs have been focusing on either anti-inflammation or analgesic effects. FlexionBio will design and develop a novel competitive osteoarthritis product: with both anti-inflammatory, analgesic effects and extended-release composite. The present proposal will combine both biological mechanisms and build on a recent regulatory path with minimal risk.</pre>
